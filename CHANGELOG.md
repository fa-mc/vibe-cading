# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). While the
project is pre-1.0 the public API is not yet stable — see
[`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) for the versioning policy (0.x phase) and
the release-cut process.

This changelog starts at the first tagged release. Earlier development history is
not retroactively seeded here — it lives in the git log. Every public-surface PR
from here on adds an entry under `## [Unreleased]`; cutting a release renames that
section to the new version and date.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial public release of the `vibe-cading` CadQuery library: parametric
  mechanical models (screws, joints, bearings, axles, gears) and Lego-Technic /
  RC interface parts.
- Tolerance system: `vibe_cading.print_settings.get_profile()` and the
  `ToleranceProfile` shape, with user-overridable `print_profiles*.json` and
  `<machine>__<material>[__<brand>]` profile keys.
- Shared primitives in `vibe_cading.cq_utils` and Lego constants in
  `vibe_cading.lego.constants`.
- `vibe_cading.tools.*` CLI utilities (preview, section slicer, hole finder,
  boolean diff, calibration helper, STEP analysis).
- `engine_api.json` wire contract (carries its own `schema_version`).
- Build provenance: `vibe_cading.__version__` (from package metadata) and
  `vibe_cading.__commit__` (build-stamped git SHA).
